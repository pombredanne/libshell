Shell Library
=============

The intent of this library is to provide an IEEE Std 1003.1 compliant
Shell parser. The library does not execute, nor interpret, Shell code.
It merely parses tokens, delegating intepretation to the caller.


Requirements
============

This library depends on the following:

 * Glib >= 2.0


Installing
==========

If the source code has been downloaded from the repository, the
`./autogen.sh` script needs to be run to bootstrap the build system. If
downloaded from a distribution archive, this is not necessary.

The library is built using the typical UNIX procedure:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

For developers, the `make check` and `make prove` targets will also be
useful. The latter compiles unit tests and runs the `prove` command
(from the Test::Harness Perl module) providing a summary of the test
results.


Documentation
=============

Documentation is generated directly from the source code using Doxygen.
In order to generate this documentation simply run `doxygen` in the
build directory. It will create a "documentation" directory, which will
contain all the documentation.

A copy of this documentation is not yet available on the world wide web.
